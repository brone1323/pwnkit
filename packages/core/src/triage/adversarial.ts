/**
 * Adversarial Debate Verification.
 *
 * An additional verification gate that pits two adversarial agents against
 * each other — a prosecutor arguing the finding is real, a defender arguing
 * it is a false positive — and asks a skeptical judge to pick the winner.
 *
 * Motivation: single-pass verification has correlated error modes with the
 * original discovery pass (same model, similar priors). An adversarial debate
 * setup has uncorrelated error modes — the prosecutor and defender are
 * explicitly instructed to argue opposing positions, so their reasoning
 * diverges. Anthropic's "Debate" paper (arXiv:2402.06782) showed this
 * pattern catches errors a single-pass verifier misses and that accuracy
 * scales with debater capability even when the judge is weaker.
 *
 * Each agent gets a fresh context — they see only the written arguments of
 * the other side, never each other's internal reasoning.

Your job: make the strongest possible case that this finding is a REAL, exploitable vulnerability that a competent maintainer should accept as a bug.

Be specific about each of the following:
1. The attack vector — exactly how the input reaches the sink.
2. Why it is reachable from untrusted input (no obvious auth gate, not dev-only code, not behind a private network).
3. What concrete impact it has (data exfiltration, privilege escalation, RCE, etc.).
4. Why a competent maintainer would accept this as a bug rather than dismissing it as "holding it wrong" or "works as designed".

Rules:
- Ground every claim in the evidence below. Do not invent facts.
- If the defender has made arguments in prior rounds, rebut each specific point.
- Write in clear, paragraph-level prose. No JSON, no bullet headers beyond the points above.
- Do NOT concede. Your role is to argue for the prosecution, even if the case is weak.

Your job: make the strongest possible case that this finding is a FALSE POSITIVE — a non-issue that should not be reported to the maintainer.

Be specific about each of the following:
1. Works-as-designed patterns — is this behavior documented or intentional?
2. Documented behavior — does the project's docs/README/CHANGELOG acknowledge it?
3. Non-realistic attack surface — does reaching the sink require attacker-controlled state that is never actually attacker-controlled (e.g. config files, CLI args, DEBUG mode)?
4. Caller responsibility — is this a "holding it wrong" issue where the caller is documented to be trusted?
5. Framework defenses — does the framework auto-escape, parameterize, or validate in a way the prosecutor is ignoring?

Rules:
- Ground every claim in the evidence below. Do not invent facts.
- If the prosecutor has made arguments in prior rounds, rebut each specific point.

Bias: when in doubt, favor "false positive" — the cost of submitting a FP to a maintainer is high (reputation damage). Only mark "real" if the prosecutor demonstrated: (1) reachable attack path from untrusted input, (2) concrete impact, (3) no obvious caller responsibility pattern.
